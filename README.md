## DMV-ChatðŸš˜

This is a Streamlit app that allows you to chat with a DMV chatbot to get answers to your questions about DMV procedures and requirements. The chatbot is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and is trained on a dataset of DMV documents and FAQs.

To use the app, simply enter your OpenAI API key and ask your question in the text input box. The chatbot will then generate a response based on its understanding of the question and the DMV documents in its training dataset.
